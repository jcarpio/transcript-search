# Transcript Search: Full-Text Search for Video and Podcast Transcriptions

## Introduction

This project is a full-text search engine designed to index and search transcriptions of videos and podcasts. It builds upon the original concept of a literary search engine and has been adapted to work with real-world spoken content.

### Features:
- üîç **Full-text search** across video and podcast transcriptions.
- üé• **Direct timestamp links** to YouTube videos.
- üìö **Pagination support** for efficient browsing.
- üöÄ **Deployed on Vercel** for a fast, serverless experience.
- üîé **Powered by Bonsai Elasticsearch** for scalable search capabilities.

## Deployment & Configuration

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hosting on Vercel

The frontend and backend are deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which provides an easy-to-use serverless architecture.

#### Steps to Deploy:
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/transcript-search.git
   cd transcript-search
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables** (Create a `.env` file in the root directory)
   ```
   ELASTIC_NODE=https://user:password@your-bonsai-elasticsearch-url

   ```
4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```sh
   vercel
   ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Bonsai Elasticsearch

We use [Bonsai Elasticsearch](https://bonsai.io/) as the search backend. This required adapting the Elasticsearch client to be compatible with version 7.x.

#### Creating the Index
To manually create the index, use:
```sh
curl -X PUT "https://your-bonsai-url/library" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "settings": { "number_of_shards": 1 },
  "mappings": { "properties": { "title": { "type": "keyword" }, "author": { "type": "keyword" }, "url_original": { "type": "keyword" }, "url_youtube": { "type": "keyword" }, "url_ivoox": { "type": "keyword" }, "location": { "type": "integer" }, "text": { "type": "text" } } }
}'
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Transcriptions into Elasticsearch
Transcriptions are stored in text files and indexed as paragraphs. To load data into Elasticsearch, we implemented an API endpoint:
```sh
GET /load-data
```
This script reads the text files, processes them into searchable chunks, and indexes them into Elasticsearch.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Performing a Search
The search endpoint is structured as follows:
```sh
GET /search?term=trading&offset=0
```
This will return a JSON response with:
- The total number of matching results.
- Up to 9 results per page (configurable).
- Highlighted keywords in the transcriptions.
- Direct YouTube links with timestamps.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Search UI (Frontend)
The frontend (`public/search.html`) is built with vanilla JavaScript and makes requests to the backend via Fetch API. The UI dynamically displays:
- **Total results found**
- **Pagination controls**
- **Clickable links to video timestamps**

## Future Improvements
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple search operators (e.g., exact match, fuzzy search, Boolean queries).
- ‚úÖ Automatic transcript processing and indexing from YouTube API.
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly responsive design.

## Credits
This project was adapted from the original Elasticsearch tutorial by [Patrick Triest](https://blog.patricktriest.com/text-search-docker-elasticsearch/) and extended to work with video and podcast transcriptions.
